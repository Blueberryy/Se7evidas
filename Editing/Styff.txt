Muzzle flash:
    1. Draw and make the muzzleflash a single colour.
    2. Make a new layer and set it as a clipping mask on the muzzleflash layer.
    3. Use the "S7MuzzleFlash" gradient to make a circle that fills up most of the muzzleflash.
    4. Use the smudge tool to make it spiky-ish.
    5. Burn the edges with the burn tool set to midtones, then to shadows.
    6. Duplicate the adjustment layer.
    7. Set the new layer as a clipping mask too.
    8. Crystallize the new layer with cell size set to 3.
    9. Set the new layer's opacity to 65% or whatever looks best.
Done.
