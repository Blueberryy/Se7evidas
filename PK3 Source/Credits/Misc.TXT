DBIGFONT: From Ultimate Simplicity

SMALLFNT:
    Author: Jimmy / Agent Spork
    Original font: Ultimate Simplicity's bigfont
    Idea Base: Inspired by Valiant which extensively uses the Ultimate Simplicity bigfont.

LOGOFNT:
    Author: Jimmy
    Idea Base: Creating a font loosely based on the ZDoom "Z" icon.
    Additional Credits: "Eriance (Amuscaria), Blue Shadow, Blox, and BouncyTEM for input via the forums while I was creating this."

GARGWING:
    Author: Jimmy, NeuralStunner (lower cases)
    Original font: "Tie Wing" by Boba Fonts
    Idea Base: In my long search for "Archery Black", the Jenocide font, someone offered this as a match. It's similar, but different enough to make an all-new font out of it. :P
