WPDSC_HITTER = "SR20 \"Hitter\" .45 ACP SMG:\nA collaboration between Cronus Corps and Sigma BTK, this gun's a cross between the Raptor and the Kronos, firing two rounds at the same time from its twin barrels at a high ROF with good stopping power.\nIt likes to sometimes jam, often jamming only one of the barrels.";
WPDSC_TEC9 = "S18 \"Kronos\" SMG:\nSimple, elegant, and effective, the Kronos is another fine piece from Cronus Corps. The Kronos found popularity with gangs for its low price tag and high concealability. For you, it means firepower whenever you need it, wherever you need it.";
