SS_HITTERSMGDESC = "The SR20 \"Hitter\" SMG is a collaboration between Cronus Corps and Sigma BTK. It was designed to be a cross between the R16 \"Raptor\" Semi-automatic Pistol and the S18 \"Kronos\" SMG, firing two rounds at once to increase the amount of rounds it fires per minute without increasing the firing speed.\n\nAfter it reached shops, a small design flaw was found: a single round doesn't have enough power to cycle the gun. Normally this wouldn't be a problem, but it was soon discovered that mixing cartridges with powder from different manufacturers would occasionally fail to cycle due to the rounds not firing with perfect timing\nDespite this, the Hitter is still manufactured and sold, as it is an otherwise good gun.";

SS_MANXDESC = "The C23 \"Manx\" Carbine is another weapon in Cronus Corps' line of 9mm guns. This selective-fire carbine was created for the civilian market and primarily finds use with civilians and law enforcement, but is available here nonetheless.\nDue to its low caliber, using it with a silencer makes it almost completely silent, making it a good choice for infiltration operations.";

Unlike most double-barreled shotguns, the AM-10 is a tube-fed pump-action shotgun.
