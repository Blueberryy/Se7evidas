# ZForms
ZForms is intended as an easy-to-use simple GUI framework for GZDoom's ZScript language for making menus easier for modders who want to create a simple menu without the development overhead of the built in menu system.

## Getting started
ZForms is heavily under construction, so examples and documentation will not be provided until the framework is more fleshed out.

However, if you want to have a play around with it in its early form, clone the repo, and put the **ZForms** folder in the root of a GZDoom structured directory or pk3.
Then, add the following line to your main ZScript file:
```c
#include "ZForms/ZF_Include.zsc"
```
From there, you should be able to play around with the system, though again - documentation will be provided when the system is in a more stable state.
