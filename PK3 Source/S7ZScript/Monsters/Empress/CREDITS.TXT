Coding: Chronos "phantombeta" Ouroboros

Sprites:
    S7_Empress: Raven Software, Skelegant, Chronos "phantombeta" Ouroboros (Recolor, misc edits)
    EPTF* sprites: Raven Software and Chronos "phantombeta" Ouroboros.
    HRSF* and HRSS* sprites: Chronos "phantombeta" Ouroboros.

Sounds: None yet :P

Misc credits:
    Credits for the idea on how to make/draw/spawn the pentagram go to TerminusEst13
    Credits for a bit of the code also goes to TerminusEst13. (Specifically, the angles in the A_CustomMissile calls in S7_EmpressPentagramCorner. That's literally the only thing I copied from DemonSteele's DECORATE code, as I just couldn't get it right)
