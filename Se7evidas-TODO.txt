(in no particular order)
This shit has to be done before any official /beta/ releases:
1. New fonts
2. Shop system

This shit HAS to be done before any official stable release:
1. Add more weapons
2. Convert inventory hacks to uservars
3. Fucking monsters (Maybe literally too...)
4. Storage system
5. Grenades

Would be nice:
1. Player customizable weapon slots
