(in no particular order)
This shit has to be done before any official /beta/ releases:
    Shop system

This shit HAS to be done before any official stable release:
    Add more weapons
    Convert inventory hacks to uservars
    Fucking monsters (Maybe literally too...)
    Storage system
    Grenades

Would be nice:
    Heretic support (Maybe Hexen too?)
    Chex Quest support
    Player customizable weapon slots
