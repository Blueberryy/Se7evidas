(In no particular order) (Stuff with an X is done, and stuff with a + is WIP)
This shit has to be done before any official /beta/ releases:
    + Shop system

This shit HAS to be done before any official stable release:
    + Add more weapons
    X Convert inventory hacks to uservars (I converted what I could)
    + Fucking monsters (Maybe literally too...)
    Storage system
    + Grenades

Would be nice:
    Heretic support (Maybe Hexen too?)
    Chex Quest support
    + Player customizable weapon slots
    Achievement system
    In-game copy of the Survival Guide
