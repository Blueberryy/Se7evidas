SUPER IMPORTANT MESSAGE: Zandronum glitches out a LOT on MP. This is because 3.0 is still beta and because the netcode is a HUGE PIECE OF SHIT.

Zandronum retardedness: (Either can't fix, or the fix is so retarded that I won't even bother fixing)
    Major: User/Client variables don't work in MP. Reason: Get/SetUserCVar doesn't work at all in (Zandronum) MP.
    Major: Weapons fuck up if you use the quick melee key.
    Major: The TEC-9/Kronos glitches out heavily on MP.
    Major: The health actor property isn't set by clients. This breaks tracers.
    Major: A_Jump (256, ...) breaks in 0-tic frames
    Major: The nerve gas grenade's gas clouds never stop moving in MP.

Bugs I can't fix:
    Major: MODINPUT_OLDBUTTONS is completely broken.

Fixed bugs:
    (Zandronum only) Visual bug: Decals don't appear.
    (Zandronum only) Major: The flare Thumper grenade never stops moving in MP.
    (Zandronum only) Major: The clusterbomb and nailbomb Thumper grenades turn into 0-tic loops in MP and freeze the game. (The 0-tic loop killer kills the loop after a bit)
