SUPER IMPORTANT MESSAGE: Zandronum glitches out a LOT on MP. I dunno if it's because 3.0 is still beta or the netcode just sucks more than I previously thought.

(Zandronum only) Major: Weapons fuck up if you use the quick melee key.
(Zandronum only) Major: The nerve gas grenade's gas clouds never stop moving in MP.
(Zandronum only) Major: The TEC-9/Kronos glitches out heavily on MP.

Bugs I can't fix:
    (Zandronum only) Major: User/Client variables don't work in MP. Reason: Get/SetUserCVar doesn't work at all in (Zandronum) MP.

Fixed bugs:
    (Zandronum only) Visual bug: Decals don't appear.
    (Zandronum only) Major: The flare Thumper grenade never stops moving in MP.
    (Zandronum only) Major: The clusterbomb and nailbomb Thumper grenades turn into 0-tic loops in MP and freeze the game. (The 0-tic loop killer kills the loop after a bit)
